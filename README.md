# Planet Simulation

This project is a simulation of a planetary system using the Pygame library in Python. It simulates the motion of several planets around a central sun based on their initial positions, velocities, masses, and gravitational forces.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
3. Run the simulation by executing the `Planet_sim.py` file

## How to Use

- Upon running the simulation, a window will open displaying the planetary system.
- The sun is represented by a yellow circle, while other planets are represented by different colored circles.
- Each planet's initial position, velocity, mass, and orbit are pre-defined in the `main()` function.
- The simulation will update the positions of the planets based on their gravitational interactions and draw their orbits.
- The distance between each planet and the sun is displayed above the planet.
- You can close the simulation window by clicking the close button or pressing the `ESC` key.

## Customization

- You can customize the initial parameters of the planets (position, velocity, radius, color, mass) in the `main()` function to create different planetary systems.
- Feel free to modify the code to add more features or functionality to the simulation.
